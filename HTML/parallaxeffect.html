    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming 
    language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
     as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
      to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning 
      that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 
(which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a 
core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and 
reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class 
libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java 
Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies 
under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java 
Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the 
OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most 
developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
